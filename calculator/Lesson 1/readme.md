1. functions in javascript

- what functions are and why we use them
- organizing code into reusable pieces
- function declarations: function name() {}
- parameters: passing information to functions
- calling functions to execute code

2. working with the display

- creating a display element to show numbers
- using getElementById to access the display
- textContent vs innerHTML
- updating the display dynamically

3. building number buttons

- creating buttons for digits 0-9
- using onclick attribute to connect buttons to functions
- passing parameters to functions from HTML
- onclick="appendNumber('7')" passes '7' to the function

4. string concatenation

- building strings by adding characters together
- using += operator to append
- "5" + "3" = "53" (strings stick together)
- understanding when concatenation is useful

5. introduction to state

- what is state? data that changes over time
- using variables to track the current input
